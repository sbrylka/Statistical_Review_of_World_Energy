## Analysis based on BP's Statistical Review of World Energy dataset

Primary energy sources can be divided in three groups based on their origin. Every primay source has been matched to its group in the table below.


|                 **Renewable**                 |  **Nonrenewable**  | **Nuclear** |
|:---------------------------------------------:|:------------------:|:-----------:|
| Water<br>Hydro<br>Wind<br>Solar<br>Geothermal | Oil<br>Gas<br>Coal | Nuclear     |


Contribution of these groups has been changing over years. At the begining of XX century and even earlier we were focused on using nonrenewable resources. Invention of nuclear reactors was a real game changer for some countries (*for example France*). Technological progress made renewable energy sources afforable and useful and its share in world energy usage is growing year by year. Actual contribution was visualized below. Yup, it was rounded.
