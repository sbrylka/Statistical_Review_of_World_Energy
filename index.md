## Analysis based on BP's Statistical Review of World Energy dataset

Primary energy sources can be devided in three groups based on their origin. Every primay sources has been matched to it's group in the table below.<br>

|                 **Renewable**                 |  **Nonrenewable**  | **Nuclear** |
|:---------------------------------------------:|:------------------:|:-----------:|
| Water<br>Hydro<br>Wind<br>Solar<br>Geothermal | Oil<br>Gas<br>Coal | Nuclear     |<br>

Contribution of these groups has been changing over years. At the begining of XX century and even earlier we were focused on using nonrenewable resources. Invension of nuclear reactors was a real game changer for some countries (*for example France*). Technological progress made renewable energy sources afforable and useful and it's share in world energy usage is growing year by year. Actual contribution was visualized below. Yup, it was rounded.<br>
